PROBLEM: The langgraph examples and tutorials code are redundant.  The developers realized that and did a quick and dirty HACK and just moved the notebooks in the "./examples" folder to the "./tutorials" folders, and then the developer "gutted" the notebooks in the examples folders and put in a placeholder that reads like this: "This file has been moved to https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/blob/main/docs/docs/cloud/how-tos/langgraph_to_langgraph_cloud.ipynb".  This wastes time and is not a clean user experience. 

SOLUTION: Provide a single "Examples Catalog" that provides a single name and location index for people to navigate to all available examples. 

Write a Python utility "file_move_cataloger" to build an indexed catalog file of all files moved from one directory to another.  

Start by scanning all folders and subfolders in a specified folder path that contain specified file type(s), e.g., ".ipynb" files, and find all files that contain a specific sentence or phrase, "This file has been moved to [file_location or web_endpoint]".  

Add an additional scanner option of "file_size < N_bytes", where N_bytes is a variable that can be set; N_bytes default value = 1000.  

From files that contain this sentence or phrase, extract the destination where each file was moved.  

Then build a Markdown file that specifies the filename, source location named "location_old", and new location named "location_new".  

Create a timestamped run log file that saves the history for each run. Name this file file_move_cataloger_runlog_{datetime}.log.  Include in the runlog header the parent folder, the scanning criteria, datetime when the scanner was run, and counts of the number of files that were moved.  

We want the utility to be general purpose but want to use it right now for a specific purpose.  For the code example here, find all file types [Jupyter Notebook] in a specified directory [parent_dir] that contain the sentence "This file has been moved to https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/blob/main/docs/docs/cloud/how-tos/langgraph_to_langgraph_cloud.ipynb".  

This is a rough set of requirements.  Flesh this out and add more requirements to make it robust.  Suggest features to make it more general purpose.
